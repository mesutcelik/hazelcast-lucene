# Search Hazelcast Grid with Lucene


## Purpose
- To provide advanced search capability.
- Other items??? (e.g. a clear API to define searchable properties, etc.)

## Technologies Used
- Hazelcast: Informative text???
- Apache Lucene:  Informative text???

## Sample Use Cases
- Give some business cases (maybe searching through large document repositories and retrieving some content for some criteria, or any other symphatic use cases???)

## Architecture
How this capability will be implemented. Lucene will be put in each Hazelcast node within a cluster, so a distributed searchable store is created???

Each node deals with its own partition indexes and thus search isolation is ensured???

A simple figure explaining the architecture???

Then, architecture highlights:
- item 1
- item 2
- ???

## Indexing Mechanism
How, in detail, the indexing is applied???


## Configuration
Configuration details required for indexing???

## Client Stuff
??? No idea, just popped in my mind ???
